# EEG_Classifier
Implementation of an Electroencephalography (EEG) data classifier using machine learning.
The data used in this project was obtaned from the study detailed in the paper below:

The study consisted in recording brain activity (through EEG) after participants had been exposed to a win or lose scenario.
The reporsitory contains two scripts:

  - Data processing: Extract, transform and load preprocessed data for using training a classifier
  - Classifier: Training and validation of a neural network to classify if EEG data corresponds to a lose (0) or win (1) event

Sensor data and numpy files can be made available upon request.
